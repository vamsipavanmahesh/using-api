== README

See the demo here http://using-api.herokuapp.com/courses/index
This app utilizes coursera API. I am not responsible for any possible loss when you are using this code. Without warranties

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* heroku create your-app-name

* git push heroku master

* your-app-name/courses/index 
 will have the search api from coursera
